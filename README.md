Planning

**Defining the problem (Topic 1.1.1)**
In this project, we are trying to create a new system for a car rental shop in which they can manage the users' data more easily and sufficiently. They wanted to purchase a computer program collecting basic information about the distance driven for each car, and also other data. The want the program to be a simple and transparent based proram, that contains easy commands that allow to create a car, or record a trip; also it should include a command to see total statistics of the data. In that way, without having solid knowledge of computing, the owner can still use the program sufficiently. Lastly, there should be a backup system so if the user somehow lost the data, or the computer 's drive is accidentally wiped, we can still have it afterwards.
