We are starting a project of making a program for a car rental shop. They wanted to purchase a computer program collecting basic information about the distance driven for each car, and also other data. The want the program to be a simple and transparent based proram, that contains easy commands that allow to create a car, or record a trip; also it should include a command to see total statistics of the data. In that way, without having solid knowledge of computing, the owner can still use the program sufficiently. Lastly, there should be a backup system so if the user somehow lost the data, or the computer 's drive is accidentally wiped, we can still have it afterwards.
We were working on writing a program to create the data files and folder for the main program: CarRentalApp, where the user can store database, scripts of the cars. It was quite easy if we defaultly enter the path for the user, but I encountered many erros if we let the user enter the path by themselves, so I installed the data folder in desktop instead, which is very easy to access.
We started planning, and the first coding we did was how to make a frame with words inside using bash script. It was quite complicated as we have to adjust so that the word we entered appears in the middle of the frame, but it wasn't that difficult.
We split in different parts: backup, delete, summary, ... I chose backup and the problem I encountered is that I don't know how to let the user choose where to put the backup files, so at the moment, I will put it in desktop. I saw summary was probably the hardest one to do, so I want to try to do it as my homework for today.


Q1. What skills have you developed so far
- A better understanding of For loop
- Also know what are man pages and how to create a man page
- A way for the user to access the documentation
Q2. What have worked for you in the classroom for CS?
- The For loops
- How we always help each other
- Learning new things every lesson
Q3. What are some things/activities strategies that you would change in the CS classroom to achieve your best in the next 6 weeks
- More activities, warm-up questions in class for students to do it themselves and can share with the class afterwards
